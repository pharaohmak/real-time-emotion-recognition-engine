## Features

- **Face detection**: This softare will detect human faces in live video streams. 
- **Facial emotion recognition**: Includes facial emotion recognition capabilities, allowing it to recognize known facial emotions from a pre-trained database. It can match detected faces with known facial emotions based on facial features, and it can identify the recognized facial expression with labels or names.
- **Real-time detection**: Supports real-time facial emotion detection and recognition in video streams, allowing it to be used for live applications, such as video surveillance, access control, or user authentication.
- **User-friendly interface**: Provides a user-friendly interface for configuring settings, managing the recognition database, and visualizing the detected and recognized faces. It may include a graphical user interface (GUI) or a web-based interface for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: The software is built using JavaScript, a popular programming language for web development and machine learning.
- **Face detection and recognition libraries**: Utilizes existing JavaScript libraries for face detection and recognition, such as face-api.js, tensorflow.js, or OpenCV.js.
- **Web-based interface**: The software includes a web-based interface, which uses HTML, CSS, and other web technologies for rendering the user interface and displaying the detected and recognized faces.

## Setup

To set up the facial recognition software locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/pharaohmak/real-time-emotion-recognition-engine.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd real-time-emotion-recognition-engine
    ```
3. Install any dependencies or libraries required for the software:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Configure the recognition database, if applicable, with known faces and labels.
5. Run the software using the provided scripts or commands, and follow any instructions for usage.

## Usage

After setting up the software, you can start the application by running:
```bash
npm start
```
Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the user interface. Follow the on-screen instructions to use the facial recognition features.
